# Wild-Rift-1st-Project
This is my first website dev project I did to practice some basic HTML and CSS.
I reference this project to that of from Daily Tuition "How to Make Complete Responsive Website Using Bootstrap/HTML/CSS" video.

I learn a lot from the project and will soon make my own without any major help!
